            <h2>Why cats are <b>cool.</b></h2>
            </div>

            <div id="first-p">
            <p>Cats are cool because they cute and chill. Just because I said cats are cool, does <b>NOT</b> mean that dogs are not cool I just think cats are cooler. I have many reasons why cats are cool and I will tell you some. First I saw a cat do a <b>backflip</b> once at my friends house and I think that is pretty cool. I also saw a cat in a stroller once on the side of the road and that was pretty chill. These are some of the reasons why cats are cool.</p>

            <h2>Cats and their breeds.</h2>

            <div id="second-p">
            <p>Cats have many breeds and here are some of the cute ones and what they do. First there is a cat that is called a British Shorthair and it has a face that looks like it is smushed and its cute. Then there is a cat that is called a American Ragdoll which looks like a normal cat, but they play fetch and stuff but they still act like a cuddly cat. Then there is a normal tabby cat that comes in a whole bunch of colors that no other breed comes in. These are just some of the major cat breeds in the world.</p>
