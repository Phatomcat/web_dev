            </div>

            <div id="first-p">
            <p>Cats are cool because they cute and chill. Just because I said cats are cool, does <b>NOT</b> mean that dogs are not cool I just think cats are cooler. I have many reasons why cats are cool and I will tell you some. First I saw a cat do a <b>backflip</b> once at my friends house and I think that is pretty cool. I also saw a cat in a stroller once on the side of the road and that was pretty chill. These are some of the reasons why cats are cool.</p>

            <h2>Cats and their breeds.</h2>
            </div>

            <div id="second-p">
            <p>Cats have many breeds and here are some of the cute ones and what they do. First there is a cat that is called a British Shorthair and it has a face that looks like it is smushed and its cute. Then there is a cat that is called a American Ragdoll which looks like a normal cat, but they play fetch and stuff but they still act like a cuddly cat. Then there is a normal tabby cat that comes in a whole bunch of colors that no other breed comes in. These are just some of the major cat breeds in the world.</p>


            <h2>Popular Cat Breeds</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Tabby</li>
            <li>Persian</li>
            <li>British Shorthair</li>
            <li>Ragdoll</li>
            <li>Maine Coon</li>
        </ul>

        <button id="button" onclick="show()">show more</button>
        <p id="hidden">These breeds of cats are popular because of their personality and each has a different one. Tabby cats are generally more outside cats and like to go and chase mice. Ragdoll cats are known for their personality and how when you pick them up, the fall over and stay still in their arms. British Shorthairs are known for being independent and want to be alone, and they are also known for being muscular cats. These are why they are popular.</p>
