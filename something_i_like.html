        <p>Here are some reasons why I think airplanes are cool. The first reason why I like them so much is because you can go like anywhere in the world in less than 24 hours. The second reason why I like planes is because they look cool with the big engines and stuff. The third reason why I like planes is because taking off and landing is fun. These are some reasons why I like airplanes.</p>
